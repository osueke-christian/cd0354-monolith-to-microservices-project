Other Notes
------
- creating a deployment automatically begins creation of pods in line with settings
- deleting deployment delete associated their pods automatically as well
- creating a service basically attaches/groups pods created by deployments using a specified selector.
hence you can create a service to group pods much later after deployments are created
- ensure the containerPort in deployment is same as exposed port in Dockerfile
- ensure spec.port in service file is same as exposed port used in reverseproxy
